# Realtime QR

A website that displays an self-updating qr-code with the current time.
I created this to sync the time of my photo camera which always drifts a little.
It also helps synchronizing the time of photos from multiple sources, if every source makes a photo of the qr-code.


## Getting Started

Just visit [realtime-qr.e8s.de](http://realtime-qr.e8s.de) and it will show the live updating qr code.


## Build

1. Install [Elm](http://elm-lang.org)
1. `elm-package install`
1. `elm-make Main.elm`
1. Open index.html and enjoy
